<h2>Introduction</h2>
<center><img src="2.jpg"></center>
<p>Pollution is the major cause of diseases and other genetical problems which has been causing harmful effect on the environment and other living beings. Here's the list of how much percentage does different types of pollution are affecting our environment:-</p>
<ol>
  <li>Air pollution: 20-30%</li>
   <li>Water pollution: 20-30%</li>
    <li>Soil pollution: 10-20%</li>
    <li>Noise pollution: 10-15%</li>
    <li>Light pollution: 5-10%</li>
    <li>Thermal pollution: 5-10%</li>
    <li>Radioactive pollution: 1-2%</li>
</ol>
<p>It is very important to reduce all kinds of pollution from the environment in order to protect the environment and human health.</p>
 <p> For the instance, as per our project we going to talk about air pollution in particular. The term air pollution is related to the release of chemicals or particles in the atmosphere which would be causing problems to living being. It is caused by the release of harmful substances like ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. These pollutants arise from power plants, cars and industries. This impacts the health of humans and lead to many respiratory diseases including asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer, etc. It may also lead to heart attack and other cadiovascular diseases. Air pollution is attributed to 11.65% of deaths globally. 91% of the the world's population is breathing polluted air. So, we need to apply some control measures.

  <h2>Causes of air pollution</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Burning of fossil fuels releases sulfur dioxide and incomplete combustion led to the release of carbon monoxide.</li>
     <li>The gases released from vehicles like cars, bikes, trucks and vans releases a lot of greenhouse gases.</li>
     <li>Large use of fertilizers like insecticides and pesticides also contaminants the air.</li>

     <li> All the household cleaning products releasing harmful gases and the chemicals released from the paints are some domestic sources of air pollution.</li>
     <li>Extraction of coals and other mining activities lead to release of harmful chemicals which affect both workers and nearby people.</li>
  </ol>

<div id="effect">
  <h2>Effects of air pollution</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Majorly affects the health of the humans such as cadiovascular diseases, lung diseases, cancer and kidney diseases, etc. It also affects the central nervous system.</li>
    <li>Smog and soot are major pollutants which affects the lungs, irritates the eyes and throat. </li>
    <li>Some pollutants like lead, mercury, benzene emmited by coal or gasoline combustion.</li>
<li>Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide traps heat released from the earth's surface is increasing the earth's temperature.</li>
<li>Depletion of ozone layer will cause harmful UV rays to reach the earth's surface which may cause skin cancer and types of skin diseases.</li>
<li>These harmful gases released will soon cause acid rain. Mainly in the industrial areas, traffic places, etc.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<div id="control">
<h2>Control Measures</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Car pooling or using public transport is one of the best method of reducing pollution.</li>
<li>Using environmental friendly paints and cleaning products as they contain harmful chemicals which may create irritating effects in the eye.</li>
<li>Use of high energy star rated devices for reducing the electrical consumption.</li>
<li>Reducing the use of equipments which runs on gasoline as it causes ozone depletion.</li>
<li>Less use of air conditioners as it also contributes to ozone depletion.</li>
<li>Burning of leaves or woods outside should be avoided as it releases harmful gases.</li>
<li>Avoid plastic bags and using filter in chimneys will also help in reducing the air pollution.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="policies">
<ol>
    <h2>Policies issued by the Government</h2>
<li>1948 - The Factories Act and Amendment in 1987 was the first to express concern for the working environment of the workers. The amendment of 1987 has sharpened its environmental focus and expanded its application to hazardous processes.</li>
<li>1981 - The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act provides for the control and abatement of air pollution. It entrusts the power of enforcing this act to the CPCB .</li>
<li>1982 - The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules defines the procedures of the meetings of the Boards and the powers entrusted to them.</li>
<li>1982 - The Atomic Energy Act deals with the radioactive waste.</li>
<li>1987 - The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act empowers the central and state pollution control boards to meet with grave emergencies of air pollution.</li>
<li>1988 - The Motor Vehicles Act states that all hazardous waste is to be properly packaged, labelled, and transported.
</li>

<div id="future">
<h2>Future of air quality</h2>
<p>We cannot say anything about the future of air quality around the world as it is uncertain to comment on it. We can simply determine it by a condition that is if humans persists to damage the environment than it is for sure that in future we would have to carry oxygen cylinders or wear masks every time. Air pollution has caused significant change in the environment and if this problem persists then we would have shortage of air.</p>

  <p>One of the best method is to use renewable source of energy i.e. which could be used again and again. This include solar as well as wind power and are more affordable to anyone. Only installation cost is there and it would be providing free energy atleast 25 years. These are the ultimate replacement for the fossil fuels.</p>
